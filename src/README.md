# Mergington High School Activities API

A super simple FastAPI application that allows students to view and sign up for extracurricular activities.

## Features

- View all available extracurricular activities
- Sign up for activities

## Getting Started

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. Create a teacher login. The password is stored as a salted PBKDF2 hash in `teachers.json`, which is ignored by Git:

   ```
   cd src
   python create_teacher.py teacher-username
   ```

   `teachers.example.json` shows the expected file shape. Run the setup command once for each teacher account.

3. Run the application from the `src` directory:

   ```
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:
   - API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - Alternative documentation: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All data is stored in memory, which means data will be reset when the server restarts.

Activity and participant lists remain public. Teacher login is required for signup and unregister operations. Teacher sessions expire after eight hours and are cleared when the server restarts.
